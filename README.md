## Project Overview
designed to provide users with a realistic banking experience while showcasing core software
development concepts, including server-client architecture, SQLite database management, and
concurrent operations. The application will be built using Java for the backend, JavaFX for the
frontend GUI, and will feature visual CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
## Getting Started
This app is only supported by Mac Intel 64x.
There are 3 stand alone files. BankServer.java, OnlineBank.java, and BankManager.java.
The Makefile will be used to run each file. First in the terminal run the "make" command to build the project. secondly, to run any of the files use make and any of the file names. Each word within the file name is separated with a under score. Ex. "make Bank_Manager". For those Using Vscode We have a launch.Json file.
## Usage
you will activate the sever app and connect to it with the client app via ip and port. The server app will allow the user to observe,monitor,and manipulate the database as necessary. The while client app will allow for user to view their data and initiate transactions.
